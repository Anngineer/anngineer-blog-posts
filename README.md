Hello! Welcome to my blog.

I’ll be sharing more projects and writing some tutorials for material that I’ve enjoyed learning over the years as I recently studied for my Computer Information Systems degree.

I’m currently working on exploring more of the topics that caught my eye in software engineering, in particular data structures and algorithms as well as discrete math. I’ve taken a course on DS&A and found it really fun, so I’m planning to dig a bit deeper into the material.

It’s easy for me to want to plan everything out perfectly in advance before starting, like flow-charting a recipe for a fancy pastry, so I’m posting this to get things rolling.

If you have any projects you’re working on as well, I wish you all the best!

Thanks for dropping by.

## Learn Programming with the Hero's Journey 5/10/25
### Advice for Adults New to Programming (Pretend You’re in a Fantasy Adventure) 
link: https://anngineer.substack.com/p/learn-programming-with-the-heros

Learning programming as an adult can feel confusing or overwhelming at times. I often found that framing the challenges as a Hero’s Journey, like the main character in a fantasy adventure, helped me find my footing if I stumbled. While most of my future articles will likely be technical tutorials, the first few focus on practical advice for meeting allies, gathering resources, and mapping out your own best path forward

#### Team Up: Mentors and Fellow Questers

Before King Arthur pulled the sword from the stone, he studied with Merlin, a great and powerful (albeit absent-minded) wizard. Many other heroes learned from those who came before them, but the white-haired wizard or witch-in-the-woods archetype shines through fairy tales and mythologies.

New programmers might not be lucky enough to have someone kick their door down, announcing their destiny or whisk them away to a new magical world, however, there are a lot of people out here who are excited to help newcomers and show them the way.

Personally, that’s one of things I most enjoy about computer science and web development in particular—the community. There are numerous ways to connect with others on a quest like yours: mentors who can answer questions when you get stuck, and those who are even a step behind you. I’ve found that when I teach a topic I’ve just learned, it really helps me remember it in the future.

#### Where to go to meet other programmers and mentors?

Some of the most commonly known online communities are found on Reddit, Discord servers, or even blog sites like Dev Community and SubStack. But many other forms of social media also connect programmers, so groups can be found on Facebook, Slack, X/Twitter, and even TikTok.

In-person social events are my favorite, and for finding those, I recommend the Meetup app, Facebook events, Reddit (for example city subreddits or programming subreddits), as well as the calendar page of local hackerspaces, makerspaces, and workshare buildings.

#### Build a map and gather resources

While this new world may feel like it is filled with new terminology and uncountable options, the upside is that there are an incredible amount of resources online. It can be helpful to check out a number of programming “roadmaps” that people share, and take notes on aspects that interest you. Mark areas that you want to make sure to visit and learn about, and over time, the strange symbols and languages will begin to make sense.

Knowing some google search operators can take problem-solving up a level. My simple favorite is“site:”. This helps narrow down a search to a specific website, like stackoverflow.com or dev.to. For example, typing site:reddit.com best IDE for newbies into google can show a number of posts on reddit with similar questions.

#### Identify your favorite stomping grounds

Just like knowing which towns are well stocked with supplies and which are hiding giant man-eating spiders, it can be helpful to identify and remember favorite resource websites. There are a number of free educational lectures out on the internet that are wonderful, like Youtube, Khan Academy, EdX, Coursera, and even MIT’s OpenCourseWare lectures.

I was delighted when I found out Udemy courses were free through my local library (and through many other libraries). It has often been my go-to resource if I want to really dig deeper into a topic. I’ve found Udemy classes to be well organized, beginner friendly, and some even have built-in programming interfaces for coding practice. Similar to YouTube, the topics for Udemy classes expand beyond coding to other fields, like business or social skills. You can search for a library near you that uses Gale for Udemy at https://link.gale.com/apps/UDEMY.

For non-lecture style resources, I plan to post an article in the future with an outline of my favorite websites. In the meantime, wherever you are in your quest, I hope that some of this advice helps a little. Safe travels, adventurer!

## Building Your Map for Learning Programming 5/11/25
### Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Learning

#### Are you teaching yourself programming and struggling to stay focused?

Maybe it feels like there’s too many routes to take, like choosing between hundreds of boxes of cereal at the grocery store, and you don’t even know where exactly you want to end up yet. Or perhaps you’re passionate but self-doubt gets in the way?

If so, you are not alone. The internet can remind me of the ocean—beautiful and full of strange, confusing systems.

And this can be pretty intimidating, especially at first.

The goal of this blog is to make the learning experience of programming and math less anxiety-inducing and a bit simpler for readers.

#### Top-Down Vs Bottom-Up Learning

What is the best method for learning programming or computer science as an adult? I’ve often heard the advice to “use a project to guide you” and “it’s different for everyone.” This definitely makes sense for a lot of reasons but may feel a bit vague for some. I personally like to look at things as either bottom-up or top-down learning.

From my understanding, one example of bottom-up would be the way math is taught in primary school in the US. If you can, try to picture a triangle. At the bottom, the base is filled with the introductory topics like addition and subtraction. Then the next level up on the triangle has something fancier like multiplication and long division. To get to the next step, it’s important to fully comprehend the stage before, and because this is taught piece-by-piece in school, students follow this path step-by-step.

In this context, top-down might be more like when a kid who plays Donkey Kong, decides that they want to design their own platform game and then goes online to look at what kind of code would do this. It is a more focused and goal oriented view of gaining knowledge.

I like to think of it as “stacked” versus “sticky” information. For bottom-up, where material is learned step-by-step, everything is stacked, organized, and falls into place. For top-down, or project-focused learning, the information sticks to each other with relevance to the end goal project.

#### If you resonate with bottom-up learning:

I’ll list some of my favorite resources in a following blog, but it might be helpful to look on Reddit or other websites that explain a map of how a traditional student would study computer science in university. For example, Open Source Society University compiled free resources to mimic a computer science degree for individuals who want to understand the material at their own pace [https://github.com/ossu/computer-science?tab=readme-ov-file#core-security]. 

Another option would be starting with high school-level computer science material like Khan Academy’s Introduction to Computer Science with Python or their Computer Programming Tutorial with JavaScript. I personally started with front end web development tutorials aimed at newbies. I’ll write another blog post soon detailing the resources I used and which I found to be the most helpful.

Whether someone goes to college or not for those classes, there is a wealth of information on the internet that can lead someone step-by-step through this map, ranging from YouTube tutorials, free lectures and assignments from MIT and Harvard, as well as educational articles.

Personally, I decided to spend evenings learning “how to teach myself programming” before I felt comfortable going to college for computer science. While there were other students in my classes who had never programmed at all before starting the Introduction to Java class, I found having a basic understanding of fundamentals and knowing how to debug helpful. It felt like I was able to focus on the more complex topics because of this.

#### If you resonate with top-down learning:

Projects and tutorials might be the way to go! When I’ve talked to companies about what they looked for when hiring, I have almost always heard the answer “an interesting project.” The interviewers emphasized how personal passions showcase someone’s internal drive and their ability to stay self-motivated.

However, for someone just starting out, this might feel a bit like interviewers are pointing to a tumultuous ocean and saying “goodness, I’d just love to judge the boat you build.” If that’s the case, where do you even start? How does one build a boat that doesn’t sink? Will it be judged by how sturdy it is? Or how lightweight it is? What tools do I even use to cut down a tree?

Following along with someone else’ project is a great way to learn the steps and tools of these projects. YouTube has a fantastic resource of educational tutorials, and Udemy tutorials can often be fully free with a library card through Gale. link

In the past, what has been the easiest way for you to learn a new topic? Maybe there is a way to use that experience to guide you into your studies moving forward. And if you’re not sure, trying both and taking notes on how you feel about them might be another way to plan things out.

Best of luck, and thank you for reading!
