## Welcome 3/6/25

Hello! Welcome to my blog.

I’ll be sharing more projects and writing some tutorials for material that I’ve enjoyed learning over the years as I recently studied for my Computer Information Systems degree.

I’m currently working on exploring more of the topics that caught my eye in software engineering, in particular data structures and algorithms as well as discrete math. I’ve taken a course on DS&A and found it really fun, so I’m planning to dig a bit deeper into the material.

It’s easy for me to want to plan everything out perfectly in advance before starting, like flow-charting a recipe for a fancy pastry, so I’m posting this to get things rolling.

If you have any projects you’re working on as well, I wish you all the best!

Thanks for dropping by.

## Learn Programming with the Hero's Journey 5/10/25
### Advice for Adults New to Programming (Pretend You’re in a Fantasy Adventure)

Learning programming as an adult can feel confusing or overwhelming at times. I often found that framing the challenges as a Hero’s Journey, like the main character in a fantasy adventure, helped me find my footing if I stumbled. While most of my future articles will likely be technical tutorials, the first few focus on practical advice for meeting allies, gathering resources, and mapping out your own best path forward

#### Team Up: Mentors and Fellow Questers

Before King Arthur pulled the sword from the stone, he studied with Merlin, a great and powerful (albeit absent-minded) wizard. Many other heroes learned from those who came before them, but the white-haired wizard or witch-in-the-woods archetype shines through fairy tales and mythologies.

New programmers might not be lucky enough to have someone kick their door down, announcing their destiny or whisk them away to a new magical world, however, there are a lot of people out here who are excited to help newcomers and show them the way.

Personally, that’s one of things I most enjoy about computer science and web development in particular—the community. There are numerous ways to connect with others on a quest like yours: mentors who can answer questions when you get stuck, and those who are even a step behind you. I’ve found that when I teach a topic I’ve just learned, it really helps me remember it in the future.

#### Where to go to meet other programmers and mentors?

Some of the most commonly known online communities are found on Reddit, Discord servers, or even blog sites like Dev Community and SubStack. But many other forms of social media also connect programmers, so groups can be found on Facebook, Slack, X/Twitter, and even TikTok.

In-person social events are my favorite, and for finding those, I recommend the Meetup app, Facebook events, Reddit (for example city subreddits or programming subreddits), as well as the calendar page of local hackerspaces, makerspaces, and workshare buildings.

#### Build a map and gather resources

While this new world may feel like it is filled with new terminology and uncountable options, the upside is that there are an incredible amount of resources online. It can be helpful to check out a number of programming “roadmaps” that people share, and take notes on aspects that interest you. Mark areas that you want to make sure to visit and learn about, and over time, the strange symbols and languages will begin to make sense.

Knowing some google search operators can take problem-solving up a level. My simple favorite is“site:”. This helps narrow down a search to a specific website, like stackoverflow.com or dev.to. For example, typing site:reddit.com best IDE for newbies into google can show a number of posts on reddit with similar questions.

#### Identify your favorite stomping grounds

Just like knowing which towns are well stocked with supplies and which are hiding giant man-eating spiders, it can be helpful to identify and remember favorite resource websites. There are a number of free educational lectures out on the internet that are wonderful, like Youtube, Khan Academy, EdX, Coursera, and even MIT’s OpenCourseWare lectures.

I was delighted when I found out Udemy courses were free through my local library (and through many other libraries). It has often been my go-to resource if I want to really dig deeper into a topic. I’ve found Udemy classes to be well organized, beginner friendly, and some even have built-in programming interfaces for coding practice. Similar to YouTube, the topics for Udemy classes expand beyond coding to other fields, like business or social skills. You can search for a library near you that uses Gale for Udemy at https://link.gale.com/apps/UDEMY.

For non-lecture style resources, I plan to post an article in the future with an outline of my favorite websites. In the meantime, wherever you are in your quest, I hope that some of this advice helps a little. Safe travels, adventurer!
