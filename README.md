## Welcome 3/6/25

Hello! Welcome to my blog.  

I’ll be sharing more projects and writing some tutorials for material that I’ve enjoyed learning over the years as I recently studied for my Computer Information Systems degree. 

I’m currently working on filling in the gap of some of the material that I wanted to learn more in depth in the software engineering field, in particular data structures and algorithms as well as discrete math. I’ve taken a course on DS&A and found it really fun, so I’m planning to dig a bit deeper into the material.  

It’s easy for me to want to plan everything out perfectly in advance like flow-charting a recipe for a fancy pastry, so I’m posting this to get things rolling.  

If you have any projects you’re working on as well, I wish you all the best! 

Thanks for dropping by.
